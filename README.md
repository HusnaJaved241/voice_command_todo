# 🎙️ Voice Command To-Do App

A simple yet powerful Flutter to-do list application that supports voice command inputs, shared preferences for local data persistence, and elegant animations — built entirely without Firebase or backend services.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎤 **Voice Command Input**  
  Use your voice to add tasks to your to-do list! Just say your task followed by the word `"stop"` and it will be added automatically.

- 📝 **Text Input Dialog**  
  Easily add tasks manually via a clean and intuitive dialog with `Add` and `Clear` options.

- ✅ **Task Management**  
  - Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
  - Delete tasks with a single tap.
  - Task state persists even after restarting the app.

- 💾 **Persistent Storage using SharedPreferences**  
  All tasks are saved locally using `SharedPreferences` in JSON format, ensuring your tasks are always available.

- 🔄 **State Management**  
  Maintains state in a clean and readable `StatefulWidget` structure with dynamic task updates.

- 🔊 **Microphone Permission Handling**  
  Uses `permission_handler` to manage microphone access securely.

- 🔁 **Smooth Animations**  
  Microphone button pulses with `ScaleTransition` when actively listening.
